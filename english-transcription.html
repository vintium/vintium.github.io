    <h1>the phonemic symbols i use for my english :3</h1>
    <p><em>note: this article assumes basic knowledge of the ipa. if you don't know anything about the ipa, hopefully i'll write an article about it soon and link it here. </em></p>
    <p>
      narrow transcription in the ipa is designed to be universal. ideally, any two people trained in the ipa could listen to speech in any language by any person and independently agree on the narrow transcription. tho this ideal is not quite the reality, it's decently close. broad transcription serves a different purpose. rather than being a way to write down speech sounds (<em>phones</em>), it's a way to write down <em>phonemes</em>. if you're unfamiliar, you can think of a phoneme as a set of phones that can't be the difference between two words in a dialect or language. for example, my pronunciation of <em>cool</em> begins with a velar phone, [kʰ], and <em>keel</em> begins with a palatalized phone, something like [k͡çʰ]. the phones [kʰ] and [k͡çʰ] are different, but they belong to the same phoneme, because in my dialect of english, [kʰ] and [k͡çʰ] can't make the difference between words (phones vs. phonemes isn't quite this simple, but this is a good starting point). every language or dialect has its own phonemic inventory, which is the smallest possible set of phonemes that can be used to describe the pronunciation of that language or dialect. so, how should we write down these phonemes? as we can see, a single phoneme can be comprised of multiple phones, and the ipa is designed for writing phones. if we want to use the ipa to write phonemes, we need to choose an ipa symbol which best represents the group of phones that belong to the phoneme. this decision is mainly writing convention, and usually the ipa symbol that is simplest among the ipa symbols for all of the phones in the phoneme is chosen. so, to write [k], [kʰ], and [k͡çʰ], which all belong to the same phoneme in many dialects of english, the convention of using the symbol /k/ is adopted. 
    </p>
    <p>this article is a list of symbols i've decided to use to represent phonemes of my dialect of english. i used the phonemic analysis of what is typically called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English#Phonology">'general american english'</a> as a base, but differed from it in a few ways. my dialect has fewer phonemes than 'general american' does, so that is reflected. also, the symbols chosen to represent many of the vowel phonemes differs from the conventions used in traditional 'general american' phonemic transcription. the changes made there are an adaptation of principles laid out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtnlGH055TA">this video</a>, which suggests a list of phonemic symbols for southern british english which is argued to be more evidence-based and intuitive. </p>
    <h2>vowels</h2>
    <p>
    i divide the vowels into four categories. the first are the two vowels that can appear anywhere (more precisely, those with no phonotactical restrictions), /ə/ and /ɑ/. the next are the <em>Checked</em> vowels, which must be followed by an obstruent, nasal, or lateral /l/. then, there are vowels which must be followed by a glide, the <em>Closing Offglide</em> vowels. then, all of the vowels that can occur before /ɹ/ are listed, including the syllabic /ɚ/.
